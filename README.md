This project aimed to assess whether MNC Corp., an apparel company based in the U.S., should expand operations into Argentina. We conducted a comprehensive macroeconomic analysis covering GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, exchange rates, interest rates, economic freedom, and human development indicators. While Argentina showed strengths such as high literacy rates, a stable Human Development Index, and access to the Mercosur trade bloc, our analysis highlighted major concerns, including high inflation, currency depreciation, and restricted economic freedom. Based on these findings, we recommended postponing expansion into Argentina until greater economic stability is achieved. All supporting materials, including the report, presentation, and dataset, are included in this repository.
